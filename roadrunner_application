I'm a master student of Informatics at Technische Universität München. I'm working on an intelligent transportation system, namely the highway A9 near Munich, Germany. I'm working with an OpenDRIVE map and some cameras mounted to the highway signs. My research is focused on calibrating the cameras to the map. Therefore I need a RoadRunner license to view and extract data from the map to proceed my research.

Timeframe: Now until 31.10.2021
