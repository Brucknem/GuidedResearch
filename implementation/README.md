# Guided Research Implementation

The main ideas and approaches created during my research are located in this folder.

---

## lib

The actual implementation containing the algorithms.

---

## misc

Some arbitrary data used for testing, visualization and development.  
Contains mostly images.

---

## run

Some runnable scripts that exemplary show the algorithms.

---

## test

Test code for testing the implementations correctness.

---

# Setup

I heavily rely on OpenCV, CUDA, Eigen and Ceres. To ease the setup process there exists the script:

- _setup_opencv.sh_

This is only tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and relies on a correct installation of CUDA and the respective Nvidia drivers for
your GPU.
