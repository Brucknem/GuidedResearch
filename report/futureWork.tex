\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Dynamic stabilization}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dynamically pick best feature detector based on optical flow performance
  \item Test on different weather/lighting conditions
  \item IMU based sensor fusion (Only for paper, no real lookout)
  \item Optical FLow / Warp field stabilization
  \item ML CNN
    \item Image MSE for calibration (unsupervised)
    \item Logistic regression on pose (supervised)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Static calibration}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Extend to global refinement of multiple cameras
  \item After initial by hand calibration with watersheder: Re-detection in new keyframes:
    \item Automatic recalibration
    \item Per frame pose estimation
  \item Automatic detection of more landmarks after initial calibration
  \item Automatic mapping pixel to object
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Vehicle pose estimation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use HD map roads and camera look-at vector
  \item Calculate ground plane/description from map
  \item Calculate depth
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Hough lines flucht punkte}
\subsection{New HD map}
