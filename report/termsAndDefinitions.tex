\subsection{Dynamic foreground and \Sc{}}
\label{sec:dynamic_foreground_static_scene}
We group parts of the world seen by the cameras into the two groups of dynamic foreground and \Sc{}.
Dynamic foreground describes all pixels that represent objects that are meant to be moving, \eg{} vehicles on the roads.
On the other hand the \Sc{} are all pixels that are not dynamic foreground, \eg{} the road, guardrails or bridges.
